Part 1----------
This was observed when running test case 88 - a bilingual test case
Steps:
1. Create a PT id selectable from the TLD by completing a PT to some train 111.
2. Initiate a PT in French-Preferred bilingual territory to train 222;
3. Validate limits.
4. Add a P/A restriction - pre-selecting train 111 from the TLD as restriction's addressee(P/A is added to protect 111 'Working')...
5. Complete the PT to 222.
6. Initiate a second PT to train 111 overlapping PT 222
7. Validate limits

Expected(according to the test):
Validation fails

Actual:
Validation passes and a P/A protecting train 222 is added to the form

Part II------------
ADDITIONAL INFO:
This test case right now appears to be saying that we should not allow a PT form to be issued if it would have to ProtectAgainst a work crew that was issued a form in a different language than that of the proposed PT. I don't recall any discussion/requirement to reject the PT in such a case; I think it needs to be clarified with CN unless something is found in the question-log or meeting minutes; also, this particular case has the forms in Bilingual territory, and it should be clarified whether it should be handled the same way for all permutations of one or both forms being in English-only or French-only areas, english over french, french over english, etc)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think we anything like it implemented in the current code(might be able to add a rule for it based on the forms' language attribute)...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part III----------
There are other issues with the test case language that should be addressed....
the test step implies that the existing PT form should have a P/A for the proposed PT; this is not possible(can't add a restriction for another train 'Proceeding', only 'Working')

Also, since the customer is going to be running the tests I think the opening notes should state that it would be best to use 2 workstations(one french and one english), or the steps should be reorganized so that the tester won't need to switch between english and french user logins.

Part IV-------------
UPDATE: there is a scanned test run that includes customer comments to the effect that the validation should fail because of the protect against being issued to another proceed train, not because of the language; so I think the question now is whether the current code is OK - and just the test case needs updating - or the test case needs updating to say the P/A is for a WT for the same train as the proposed PT, and the code changed to fail the validation.

2. complete a second WT to some train Y over the exact same limits as the first.
3. initiate a 3rd WT form to train Z

Expected: it depends on whether we need to heed the test case comment, or the test case results, or current CTC behavior.
1. the test case comment says first P/A should be for the oldest WT
2. the test case result implies the first P/A should be for the newest WT(train Y)
3. the CTC system shows the oldest WT first

Actual:
The first P/A shown on the form is for the newest WT

===========================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - logic to convert HHmm time string into data string was unable to
handle daylight savings time phase changes because of calls to Calendar methods(which also
fall well short of correctly handling).

=============================================================================================
RESOLUTION: fixed indirectly by changes made for bug #13371 (see resolution there for more
info. Briefly, DateValidatingJText widget was changed to hold a timeZone, and pass it on to
DateUtils.java logic to convert HHmm time string, which was changed to return a java Date
based on the input timeZone - which is now assigned from OsReportBox based on the OS location
being reported(i.e. the location out in the field).

Expected:

the /orac partition does not reach 90% or higher as checked with 'df -k' command

Actual:

the /orac partition reaches 91 and 100 %

Note: the oracle 11.2 install appears to be writing trace audit files to directories under a root /diag folder (likely the oracle default) instead of where the script currently expects them to be; the default folders for trace/audit files changed for oracle 11, but there is a parameter that controls it that could be set during RDBCREATE(not sure if it is incorrect there, not set at all, or what, but it's probably preferrable at this point to adapt the scripts to work rather than change the parameter and redo RDBCREATE's)

==============================================================================
CAUSE: code and configuration error: 
1. the WATCHORACLE script used by other spectrum installations that have oracle 11 was never brought into the CN_RTC_OCS branch; the old WATCHORACLE did not include the cleanup_new_oracle() function that uses an oracle utility(ADRCI) to cleanup the trace/audit files of a configurable age. 
2. furthermore, the oracle audit_file_dest, diagnostic_dest, core_dump_dest parameters were incorrectly to the constant TRACE_PN, which RDBCREATE assigns as ../dbs/tracefiles/<SID> - i.e. a different root for each SID; this caused the ADR base value used in the cleanup routine to default to the folder for the last SID to be runup(in this case web1).

RESOLUTION:
1. brought over the WATCHORACLE script from the mephisto 4.7 spectrum
2. updated the init.ora_11_20 scripts for each SID by setting the values of parameters audit_file_dest=ADUIT_PN, diagnostic_dest=DIAG_PN, and core_dump_dest=DIAG_PN - as they are for the 4.7 version on mephisto; this enables the new WATCHORACLE script to successfully find and remove the old files for each SID.

OPEN QUESTION: the existing dump_clean.sh script compresses the trace files it is able find - which is far fewer than oracle 11 produces - in most cases over 7 days old...and then deletes any compressed files that appear to be more than 14 days old; I was not able to determine from clearQuest/clearCase why this script was added(beyond Rich Gotz's bringing it in as part of the change to replace some of the oracle replication with DBMS copy jobs(cleartQuest #8432), IMHO its need is especially suspect when the existing WATCHORACLE script was set to simply remove files older than 5 days. It might have been installed as a band-aid of sorts in reaction to WATCHORACLE failing to do the right thing. The need for the dump_clean.sh script's compress/saveFor2weeks is a question for CN.
 

UPDATE: WATCHORACLE changed to no longer do any sqlplus queries; last one attempted was to determine the audit file folder, and caused the script to itermittently hang within the sqlplus block; the script now just uses a hard coded path....the entire code block including the test for oracle sid was removed after the oracle sid test itself was observed causing trouble...at least in part this was caused by the /usr/local/env/.profile script containing export commands/variables not properly prepared for when the script is executed as root(e.g. the variable must be declared and set and exported separately)"

# Add a new web box to an existing system.
# Restart the adm or directly run ftpsvg sync.

Expected:
* The web box receives the necessary resources for every web app.

Actual:
* The web box is missing resources for the TrackLines web app.

Look into changing the where the app looks for resources and/or fixing ftpsvg to always copy the same files.

problem stems from the following 2 current facts of life:
1. Tracklines expects the latest/current svg files that correspond to the current TLD's to be in the ""top-level"" ../tomcat/ROOT/svgd/Online folder(i.e. it is too lazy to figure out which of the possible ../Online/dbkey_nnnn folders contain the latest svg files).
2. the files are only sent to that top-level folder when there is a new dbkey number.

the files get copied to the top level ../Online folder on the web server when there is a new dbkey number; this is done by svgexp calling the ftpsvg script with the key number as a parameter, when svgexp sees there is a new dbkey(first time it runs, or data activation)...if there's no new dbkey number svgexp calls ftpsvg with the 'sync' parameter, which only ""syncs"" the svg files in /home/svgd/dbkey_n to the webserver ../Online/dbkey_n folder.

more NOTEs:

there are 2 ways to fix this; either : 
> change WEBTracklines to figure out which dbkey_nnn folder(s) to load the svg files from
> change the ftpsvg script to collect the latest svg files by scanning /home/svgd/dbkey* folders on the ADM(e.g. add all the svg files from the highest dbkey folder, scan the next highest and add any svg files that have not yet been added, repeating until the lowest number dbkey folder has been scanned)

==========================================================================
CAUSE: code error - RTCII program and script not made to handle case where
webserver is added after ADM server is runup at least once; in this case
when svgexp is restarted or ftpsvg is called from command line without a
dbkey number argument, the ftpsvg script defaults to opt_sync option that
before this change was only syncing the dbkey_xxx folders on the webserver.

RESOLUTION: added syncLatestTLDViewSvgs() sub routine to ftpsvg script to
send svg files for the latest TLD views to webserver when ftpsvg called
without a dbkey version number.

FYI - decided against making WEBTracklines ""smart"" enough because it would
involve comparing timestamps with db_journal oracle table entries, and possibly
needing to pull the files in the correct order from multiple folders; given that
plus known issues with playback not working when journal entries not found it
seemed simpler to keep current scheme and force the folder used by Tracklines
to be synced. It might be nice to have them put into a ""latestTLDView"" folder
instead of being dumped into the top-level root directory for the dbkey_nnnn's;
CTC system doesn't do that.

UPDATE - when installed on sdm1ocs, the new method only processed the latest dbkey
folder from sdm1ocs:/home/svgd; this folder contained only svg files for the test
development system, and as a result the tracklines display failed when selecting
other views(which were in older dbkey versions) an updated version(r174162) of
the ftpsvg script was checked in 04-14-16 - jim

expected result:

current result:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAUSE: code error; problem was originally reported as being due to timezone difference between the location of the 2 forms, but it was not related to timezones; what happened was the ""trailing"" pt1 form was disqualified as rollup/fullfill candidate because it was erroneously flagged as being worked on (in other words, in progress or being modified, superceded, etc)...this was because of an incorrect test in an if statement that is supposed to prevent the form's disqualification if the form being worked on was in fact the form whose item was selected for OS report...

when a PT form is initiated or selected, STK/Rule105 tracks which ""touch"" the form limits are required to be PROTECTED; for both the leading and trailing forms, this included the rule105 track between Mabel and Nancy; when the OS report was initiated, that Rule105 track was set to PROTECTED because the leading form was selected; when the trailing candidate was being checked to see if it was being worked on, the rule determined that only one of its required items for protection was already PROTECTED - the 105 track; and then flagged the trailing form as being worked on because the PROTECTED item was not part of the leading form's limits.

RESOLUTION: changed if-check to check the leading form's protected items instead of form items; this prevents the trailing form from incorrectly being flagged as being worked-on.

CAUSE: config error/funky old oracle forms not ready for newer xkb ""features""

RESOLUTION:

Created a new keymapping that is automatically loaded by script at user login.

created .xkb file(s) to disable NumLock key and modifier and map all the numeric keypad number keys to always send numbers(instead of doing page-up, etc when num loc is off); multiple files are needed due to differences between redhat and ubuntu installs, and also for use with french keyboard.

created ../WORKSTATION/user/local/bin/xkbReset.sh to be called from openbox autostart script, to run in the .xkb file based on operating system and language.

Note: a simpler script to execute only xmodmap commands to do the same thing were tried but found to interfere with Alt-F1 overview selection(might be worth trying again from within the autostart, but xkb documentation and the Xmodmap files on the redhat installs advise against this, but as things now stand  this solution is working and I've burned up too much time already)

Expected:
The system should display the ""No data available for selected time period"" popup message upon submission of the playback configuration form. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAUSE: part configuration error and part code errors:

1. SQL query for authority events was missing parentheses around subvision exclusion clause; this caused bogus result-set as well as making oracle appear to incorrectly continue the query instead of short-cutting out(this same query came from the ages-old RTC2 playback and is still wrong in there).
2. the Message.properties file containing resource strings used by playback was missing entries on the web3ocs server.
3. a console() trace log message call for the console() funtion that does not exist in old javascript was merged in from the non-plugin version; problem only surfaced when trying to load data for multiple time segments where first segment contained no events to be played back(was difficult to find because the IE 11 debugger went ahead and included the routine, so not only did the debug/inspect-element tool not flag it as an error but it also made playback work fine with the same code as long as I was in the debugger)

1. change to wrap clause in parentheses initially made Playback correctly give the ""no data for time period message"", but on subsequent attempts playback would not progress past the time configuration window(not even to open the debugger), which turned out to be caused by Playback not being able to find the resource string for the ConfigurePlayback window title bar(no idea why it worked initially).

2. the Messages.properties file(s) appeared checked in to two different folders in SVN, which caused updates to it to not be installed to where playback picks them up; solution to this was to delete the copy from the ../Playback/WEB-INF/classes folder, rebuild and redeploy... this solved issue number 2 above that was found during retesting...

3. removed the console() trace calls from the SVG-plugin version of playback"

Expected result: When forms are placed - they are not visible on the map,  but can be operated from Form summary.  

Actual result: When forms are placed - they are not visible on the map,  and they are not operable from form summary.  

==================================================================================================
CAUSE: code error? When filtering out forms whose items are not included in the list of visible items on current TLD's, form summary was filtering out forms which had no process image items from limits highlighted on the TLD.

RESOLUTION: changed filtering of forms based on visible items ids to test against form's protected items instead of tld-highlighted items(replaced getTldHighlightedItems() call in SummaryTableModel.java with call to getItemsProtect() ). To make this work for both movement authority and rtc-protection forms, changed AbstractLimitsForm and BlockLimit getItemsToProtect() method to include the returned items from new FormUtils getOccupiableLimitItemIds() when the usual method to get tld-highlighted and stk-protected items returns an empty set; the new FormUtils method returns all tracks and switches that are in the form's process image value items;  this allows the form to be flagged as found to include items on current TLD displays, and thus to not be filtered out from the FormSummary.

Finally, please be aware that the above change means that a form with only an STK-protect item visible on an overview - if that is ever possible- will now be included on the FormSummary(such a form would have been filtered out before); this was OK'd by Will.

FYI - about the note about not being able to select from the TLD: per will this part is functioning as expected/written in requirements/question log, etc..."

Expected result:  TOP form should be validated successfully, and create 2 follow behind boxes, one for each PT. 

Actual result: TOP validation is rejected.
(Note:  when two PTs are going opposite directions - from 1 point, outwards from each other - validation is successful.
Example:  1st PT from B to A, 2nd PT from B to C, TOP from A to C)

======================================================================
CAUSE/RESOLUTION: FUNCTIONS AS DESIGNED

reproducing the scenario the system gives the reasons for the TOP being rejected
as being due to the limits of the TOP extending beyond the end limit of each PT.

in the scenario described, the TOP would be rejected for overlapping PT-1 even if PT-2 was not there(because PT-1 ends at B and TOP goes all the way to C); similarly, the TOP would be rejected for overlapping PT-2 even if PT-1 was not there(because TOP includes A, but the PT-2 ends at B).

the the noted case of the PT's going away from each other, the TOP does not extend beyond the end limit of either PT, so is allowed.

to see 2 follow behinds for PT's seemingly headed toward each other:
> create PT-1 from C to A
> create PT-2 from A to C (should get an After restriction for PT-1)
> create TOP from A to C (should get FollowBehind restrictions for both PT-1 and Pt2)

Note: Though we shouldn't get a MoveTrain() on a non-existent train from REF in cases where we don't erase the train, we should still check so that TM does not failover needlessly

----------------------------------------------------
CURRENT FINDINGS:

1. unable to reproduce the second failover - i.e. REF's vomitting on the UIResponse associated with non-existent workflow; in general that scenarion is going to be covered by another bug # 11991

2.in trying to reproduce bug, saw another problem:

<pre>
   2016-02-07 13:00:31,794 FATAL [CommonJmsListener] Exception occured during message handling of message            
       AbstractInitServiceMessage     [applicationName=REFServer, becomeActive=true]
       java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
           Can not set boolean field  ocs.us.ref.uimngt.UiManager.notReady to null value
	at ocs.us.core.cache.OcsCacheManager.updateAllFromCache(OcsCacheManager.java:286) ~[Core.jar:?]
	at ocs.us.core.lifecycle.CommonLifecycleManager.handleStateChangeMessage(CommonLifecycleManager.java:501)[Core.jar:?]
       java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:

	at ocs.us.core.cache.OcsCacheManager.updateAllFromCache(OcsCacheManager.java:286) ~[Core.jar:?]
</pre>

It was determined that the ocs cache must have been cleared at some point leaving the test system in an invalid state; this much
can be reproduced by clearing the cache from the SB COM...there''ll probably be a bug written to say not to allow it anymore(if it is determined we must make the system prevent such foolishness...in CTC could always go into spectrum and dbu init relations).

3. The TrainCatalog(s) in the java apps still have the trains - until the COMs are cold-started - i.e. the java world does not
know the trains have been trashed until after a cold start when an train form attempts to move the train( you can trash the trains in oracle, restart the ADM, failover from one COM to another, etc, and the TrainCatalog will still contain the trains it knew about)

4. We are awaiting answers from CN on whether we should explode when form tries to move train; if not we could check for train's existence in catalog before trying to move the train in MoveTrainToAdjacentOcsParkingSpot...

5. Cancelling a train form works even if train is no longer there(action handler checks for train in catalog beforehand).

6. Where action handlers do check for train in catalog, they log to ref.log when not found; CN would really want to know when the trains got trashed; how we do that is also part of questions to CN.

Steps to check:
1. Place TOP on track with foreman name 'user1'. 
2. Place TOP on top of user1 (to overlap)  and name the foreman 'USER1'.

Expected: Conflict box should not show up after form validation. 
Actual: Conflict box comes up. 

=======================================================================
Cause: missed requirement

Resolution: changed logic which matches on addressee to convert to upper-case before matching. Applied same scheme for all addressee matching for all movement authority forms(TOP, PT, WT).

================================================================
NOTE FROM JIM:
The CTC system does not ignore case when checking for need to generate the conflict box. For example:
1. Complete a TOP-1 from A to C to foreman Jones;
2. Complete a TOP-2 from E to F to foreman JONES;
3. Initiate a TOP-3 by pre-selecting the addressee for TOP-2(JONES) from the trackline display and selecting limits overlapping TOP-1(to Jones) from B to D.

TOP-3 opens with the conflicting with Jones box A

finally, it turns out that like equalIgnoreCase(), the java toUpperCase()
string method does what we want without needing to pass a locale argument;
there is a unit test added to TopOverlappingLimitTrimmerTest.java that 
confirms this behavior.

12734,Story,CN_Customer_Feedback,,Closed,4,PT into a siding is removing the train id in the siding if the authority is fulfilled.,cn customer,,"Aug 03, 2016 07:32 AM",REF - Proceed Train,,"Dec 16, 2015 12:00 AM",,,0,0,"Dec 16, 2015 09:14 AM","Aug 03, 2016 07:32 AM",Duplicated by #11753,,0,,Development,No,,CN OCS,2-May,NA,,"When a PT is issued into a siding the system places a ""fake"" occupancy and Id on the siding.
We had asked for that in order to retain the location of the train in the siding when the authority is fulfilled.

If the train is meeting two or more trains we have to fulfill his authority before we can issue him his after clearance. If the train id is removed on the fulfill there is no easy method to restore this id back to the trackline and the train id is required to issue an authority. Also we do not want to ""lose"" the train in the siding and forget about them.

It should work like so. Train authority into siding fulfilled. The display keeps the Id and occupancy in the siding. When authority is issued out of the siding for the train then this occupancy and id is removed.
Otherwise the RTC can do a remove train to remove this id in the siding if it is no longer required."

we currently are writing to separate files so we don't have to append and watch the output from each jsp page get improperly and incomprehensively interleaved into the logfile; also, by not appending we don't have to be concerned with the files growing forever, though this does mean that we only get logs of the last page invocations.

Steps:

1. initiate a TGI session
2. do ls -lrt in /home/logs on the webserver

Actual:
1. There are several tgi.*.log files present (e.g. tgi.DataUpdate_jsp.log, tgi.TgSelectData_jsp.log, etc)
2. The tgi.* files are overwritten each time a new TGI session is launched.

Expected:

1. there should be one traingraph.log file in /home/logs
2. the traingraph.log file is recycled as our other java apps via log4j config file

Note:
supposedly what should just work is:
1. download apache log4j and commons jar files that are old enough to work with tomcat B.C.
2. add a log4j.properties (or xml) file to Traingraph/WEB-INF/classes setup to recycle the file
3. ensure the log4j files are deployed to the webserver along with the rest of Traingraph, into Traingraph/WEB-INF/lib
4. remove the sys-out redirects added for #12286 and replace with log4j setup constructs
5. change System.out.println()'s to LOG.debug (or whatever level is proper for the message)

ER, ACTUALLY(regarding item 1 in the above note)...WEBPlayback's WBPDao.java class writes log messages to /home/logs/Webplayback.log) [which means this guy must already have a log4j that works, but one folder has v1.8 and another has v1..jar ]"

Upon further review. It looks like the procedure DoSigOtherComState() in acop.p is writing to these relations on the spare adm (TEARPKG, PKGVIEW, CARIGHT) before dum gets a chance to copy them. We believe this causes these errors. This DoSigOtherComState() should not trigger when the Other Com State change is the spare coming up. Both Will or Peter V. can help if more information is needed."

Step 8 - Create 5 RTCP overlapping TOP1.
I used Mont Joli - Isle Verte to St Simone

Create 5 RTCP with the same limits as above

Then I created 5 RTCP overlapping TOP1B 
TOP2B from St Simone to Mile 161 which not overlapping TOP1A or the previous 5 RTCP issued.
I created RTCP from St Simone to Isle Verte.
I modified the end limit to mile 161.
Expected Result
I selected Validate and it lists TOP2B .
Actual Result 
Selected Validate and it lists TOP2B and all of the RTP 1-5 that are not in the overlap. (note it does not list TOP1A which is good). 

It seems that the original RTCP's (1-5) are still thinking they go to the switch instead of the whole mile 163. Just my theory though."

=====================================================================================================================================
Resolution:
The analysis showed that none of the listed relations need to be resized to address the requirement of ""growing capacity"" for the life system of 20%.
Reasons for this finding are manifold:
  1. Some of the relations are part of the base platform functionality supporting Energy Market applications and are not used for CN OCS, at all (e.g. measured value / counter value configuration).
  2. Some relations describe static system configuration aspects. These relations have been configured for CN OCS and will never change throughout the lifetime of this system.
  3. Some of the relations are of a specific meta-structure that ALWAYS shows 100% fill level, even if the relation is completely empty.
  4. Some relations are padded with ""spare records"" and provide ample space (i.e. more than 50% spare capacity) for additional growth if necessary.
Only one relation, SANWTXT, was modified. SANWTXT contained outdated records. The relation was re-initialized and refilled with actual project data. It now shows a spare capacity of 38%.
Analyzing the database further it showed that those relations that constitute the ""process image"" (e.g. tracks, switches, and similar devices) have enough capacity to cover roughly 4x the currently modeled territory.

===========================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - logic to convert HHmm time string into data string was unable to
handle daylight savings time phase changes because of calls to Calendar methods(which also
fall well short of correctly handling).

=============================================================================================
RESOLUTION: DateValidatingJText widget was changed to hold a timeZone, and pass it on to
DateUtils.java logic to convert HHmm time string, which was changed to return a java Date
based on the input timeZone - which is now assigned from OsReportBox based on the OS location
being reported(i.e. the location out in the field). Changed OsTimeValidationAugmenter
readDateFromFields method to convert entered date and time fields into Date representation
basked on input timeZone/daylight savings status, and to flag as invalid times within the
2 o'clock hour on spring forward.

NOTE: the dateTime handling should really be refactored, but I didn't think it would make
much sense to do that without first updating to Java 8, which has purportedly finally
fixed the shortcomings of having to use Date and Calendar.

Precondition: a fresh install distributed system (or at least one where all authorities have been cleaned out)

Steps:

1. Startup system and wait for COMs to become hot with each other (PC complete and SB complete).
2. BEFORE creating any forms, failover the COMs.
3. AFTER the failover, repeatedly create any type of authority form (RTCProtections the easiest to do quickly).

Expected:

System allows creation of up to MaximumAuthorityNumber value as defined in the ref.properties file

Actual:

Once the number of forms in the system reached 50 - the MaximumAuthorityNumber default value as defined in the REF spring file -  the system throws NoAvailableFormNumberException with message ""the system has run out of available form numbers"" when attempting to create a new form.

Explanation:

The machine that becomes the PC COM is taking the max authority number value from SequentialAuthorityNumberGenerator cached in Mnesia; this object is initialized with values configured in spring but under this scenario is never updated with the configuration file value because:
> the writing of the max auth number value out to mnesia would normally have been triggered by form creation(since no forms were created before the failover, no  update was triggered.
> the configuration file is not re-read by the new PC COM after failover.

*Actual*

====================================================================================================
CAUSES:
1. code error: the rule that checks if PT is out ahead of the OS'd location was flagging the first PT as having
limits with increasing mileages and erroneously disqualifying the first as rollup candidate.
2. configuration error: the COMPANY subdivision mileages in at least one place are incorrect: the M2TK track (immediately to the user's left of the KnownPoint at HOTMAIL) has E_S mile 7700/W_N mile 7674, but the WSW switch
(immediately to left of M2TK) has mileage of 7823; for all devices within the same sub, mileages should be either increasing or decreasing from each device to the next when traversed in the same direction. (It looks like the west switch mileage might have been mixed up with that for the east switch)

RESOLUTION: changed aforementioned rule to take subdivision into consideration when checking
for increasing/decreasing selection, by using only devices from the first PT that are in
same sub as the OS reported item. 

Also, The mileages for the switches were corrected using SDM on db1cn (not pushed) and bld1cn."

Steps:
1. Open web trackline.  Choose subdivision and click submit. 
I tested in MontJoli sub, but almost all of them are showing up incorrectly. 

Expected: tracks show sidings and switches. 
Actual :  sidings and switches are showing up incorrectly, - has some line sticking out of sidings, 
and some siding have holes in them. 

This problem seems to be fixed with database changes. This should be rejected. If there are other problems with webtracklines' display, we should issue a new bug.

This bug was not fixed with any database changes. This bug was fixed on the FAT system by failing over the adms and possibly clearing out the tables.

================================================================================================================
UNABLE TO REPRODUCE: the original problem was likely indirectly ""fixed"" when an update to the SVG files was triggered - either by database update(or backout of bad CN update), or separate bug fix to the ftpsvg script.

the web2ocs webserver was hooked up as the web-server for the development distributed system (adm1cn, adm2ocs2 , etc), and 2 other issues were observed (and a new bug created and resolved for one of them).

1. the ftpsvg script could not handle the name of the new T7 web-server(see bug #13411)
2. the /home/svgd directory was found missing from the spare ADM on the test system; this will cause the svgexp to be unable to create the svgd file; the directory is created during init_spectrum, which we investigated; re-ran init_spectrum on the spare dev system adm with the other ADM STOPSOS'd and it created the directory as expected. Looking at the init_spectrum script, it appears the only way it should fail is if the SpecHost is borked, which could be before-spectrum thing, but in any case it looks like either an install issue or perhaps the folder was simply deleted by mistake at some point.

Steps:  
1. click on web trackline. 
2. choose a subdivision.  (I used Mont Joli, but any other subdivision are showing up the same). 
3. choose date, check Authorities checkmark, and click submit. 



4. Web trackline screen opens and it has xxxXXXXXxxx everywhere. 

Expected - xxxXXXXxxx is not showing up on the screen. 
Note:
Authorities are showing up correctly. 
If choose date range more then 5 days back - xxxXXXXXxxx is not showing up. 

*==================================================================================
CAUSE:*  web database maintenance scripts not being installed to /home/s/sys, and also not executing automatically when installed; this causes the SID to near it's capacity and data inserts to eventually start failing; events that occurred thereafter were not recorded; thus there was not snapshot data for the time selected and the tracklines ID fields could not be properly initialized.

There is a disconnect here between how our test system webserver box is updated as compared to how CN's test system webserver is done, and also between CN's test system webserver and their production system webserver.

* On our development/test systems the web server installs apparently used the Grafik configuration, which means that the web maintenance scripts are not included in any subsequent UPDASOS.

* the CleanRecData script run from the cron calls the webpbdel script(that was missing) with a -f argument, which tells the script to only take care of svg files and not do anything with the oracle table data.

* CN's test and production system webservers do not use UPDASOS; therefore the install instructions will need to be updated(see resolution section).

* CN's production system webserver has a differerent crontab entry that doesn't even call the CleanRecData script; instead it calls a script named doDumpArchive that manages the web2 svg files and database tablespace by calling the webpbbexp script with sensible start/end-date and export-filename arguments (the export script also removes the records from the tables); this doDumpArchive script is already present in /home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*RESOLUTION:* 

Be aware that this bug was written to report the same problem on all web application trackline displays(both WEBPlayback and WEBTracklines use the same svg representations - when checking WEBTracklines, there is no option to enter a date/time).

for our webserver's (web2ocs and web3ocs) 

* re-ran init_spectrum and selected WEB at the 'Enter Spectrum configuration file' prompt( i.e. config_WEB); then did UPDASOS, to copy the following files into the/home/s/sys:

>webpbddel
>webpbdexp
>webpbdimp

* (the UPDASOS currently also copies webarch and webexp, but these are spectrum programs that do not need to be on the webserver...)

* Ensure that that web3 SID is up and -  as root - run the /home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX/doDumpArchive script to:
** copy existing svg files to a backup folder in /tmp/WebDataBackup_*
** collect old records from tables and export them to file(compressed) under /home/db_archive/<4-digit-year>/<3-letter-month-abbrev>/<day-of-month> (e.g /home/db_archive/2016/OCT/23/23OCT16-04:00-08:00.Z)

* Ensure that the following line(s) is added to the webserver's crontab:
<pre>
# Create playback archives only if web type server on WEB
30 23 * * * [ ""`uname -n|cut -c1-3`"" = ""web"" ] && [ -x /home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX/doDumpArchive ] && /bin/su - spsy -c ""/home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX/doDumpArchive"" 2>&1
</pre>

This crontab line should replace the line which calls CleanRecData.

*FOR CN's WEBSERVER:*

We need to make sure that steps are included with the installation instructions for webservers, i.e.:

To ensure that the web2 oracle sid does not become full and unable to record new events:

* the webpb* scripts must be copied from the ADM's(or build machine's) /home/s/src/code/tsbase/svg/webexp folder to the webserver's /home/s/sys fold
* the crontab line which calls CleanRecData script must be replaced with the follwing line in the webserver's crontab:
<pre>
# Create playback archives only if web type server on WEB
30 23 * * * [ ""`uname -n|cut -c1-3`"" = ""web"" ] && [ -x /home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX/doDumpArchive ] && /bin/su - spsy -c ""/home/s/GLOB/bin/SPUX/doDumpArchive"" 2>&1
</pre>

FINALLY, please beware that when I tried to run webpddimp to re-import the exported tables into the web3, it appeared that ALL of the HIS*_EVENTS records went into the SS*EVENT tables  instead of being loaded into HIS*_EVENTS; I did not try to address this problem at this point in time, since there is another bug assigned to CN_CUSTOMER dealing with the maintenance scripts not working correctly...in other words, the above resolution will take care of this particular bug, but no more; also beware that the webpbdexp script currently logs progress to file under /tmp/WebDataBackup_nnnn, but removes the logs on exit(this should've been done differently - it would be nice to have at least the logs for the prior execution)

==========================================================================================
CAUSE: configuration errors

RESOLUTIONS: 

1. at least one of the mmi workstation installs did not include the correct version of the Profile_0150.spectrum_oracle script; the incorrect version had the setting of the NLS_LANG environment variable commented out; the oracle forms require NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1 to correctly process accented characters, otherwise oracle erroneously attempts to convert them and fails in doing so( this can be checked by doing 'env | grep NLS' from a shell on each mmi). The earliest svn revision with the correct setting is r174198, as checked in for issue #11945...I did not change the OS report to capitalize all input.

per attached corrections doc...

2, 3, 4, 5, and 13 in REFFormLabels_fr_CA.properties, changed Form.Pt.ProtectAgainstType.PT and Form.Wt.ProtectAgainstType.PT values from Avancer to Avancant;

6, corrected message text in di_usertext.j

7, 8 - it appears that the usertext relation was not correctly initialized; problems did not occur on all8cn after running in change needed for territory transfer report; on test system usertext relation contained truncated strings; suggest we make sure relation is updated with curent *.j file content.

9, 10, 11, 12 - was informed by Sean that Rhona will be doing the changes that require changing database thru SDM tool.


13. in REFFormLabels_fr_CA.properties, changed Button.CompleteLabel value from Continuer to Compléter;

14. in TMClientLabels_fr_CA.properties, replaced all 'Ã©' character pairs with é(also replaced the 'Ã' at end of word deja with à).

also:

in REFFormLabels_fr_CA.properties changed Form.State.COMPLETED value from Complété à to Complété.

replaced 'Sommaire de inverser position des aiguillages' with 'Sommaire des aiguillages en position renversée' in di_usertext.j'; running in the dot-j file for this(and #6 above) change apparently corrects the problems with message strings being truncated(see items 7 and 8 above)...one such case in the attached document is incorrect in that it states that the french message shown should correspond to the english message output when trying to logoff while there is a form open(the example given occurs when trying to logoff while a TerritoryTransferReport is open; in either case the messages are same as for CTC now)"

Actual:

SQL query on web1 SID shows that form did not get inserted into oracle; this means that the form also will not show up in playback.

MAXIMUM_SEGMENTS_RESTRICTIONS_IN_AUTHORITY defined in /home/s/src/include/aum/Api/Authority/AuthorityDefaults.h looks like it'll be equal to 4; this value is checked by webarch and if too many segments/restrictions you get the message:

it looks like 1 segment + 3 P/A's + 6 switch warnings + 6 switch permissions....


The problem can be reproduced in the test topology OCST sub by creating a WT form from mile 120 to the known pt at INIGO, with all switches in reverse position, that overlaps 3 forms that system will generate P/A's for
(add permissions for each switch before transmitting).

* The auth-cleanout script clears mnesia on both coms and both adms

*Actual:*
* The auth-cleanout script only clears mnesia on the primary adm that the release was installed on.

*Reason:*
* The script calls a clear_mnesia_tables.sh script which is located in the ocs.us code directory. This directory is not on any of the other servers.

=========================================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - the culprit script called by the cleanout script is in a source code
folder that is present only on development machines...the script holds obvious dangers for the production
system, and since the test system reflects the production system the folder containing the source code for the script is absent on the test system.

RESOLUTION: changed the cleanout script to directly call the clear_mnesia_tables.erl script that is
in /home/s/sadm/scripts/erl_scripts instead of calling it indirectly through the clear_mnesia_tables.sh
script in the source code folder that is not present on test and production systems.

CAUSE: configuration error and code error; system locale ""sometimes"" set LC_CTYPE to en_US.UTF-8; this was especially evident on mmi boxes where the latest Profile_0150.spectrum_oracle script had not been installed... many ""external"" readers expect ISO-8859-1, causing character conversion problems not only for CDLS, but for oracle forms as well.

RESOLUTION: replaced earlier correction that passed of hard-coded ISO-8859-1 charset parameter with call to new CharSetUtil getSystemDefaultCharset() method, which returns the default character set assigned at VM startup based on system locale(and also outputs to app log a warning message that locale may not be set correctly if result is not ISO-8859-1). earlier resolution for bug #13258 says to ensure the locale configuration is setup correctly by the install(we should do more to clean this part up though, i.e. to make sure we have canadian parameters are used consistently instead of mixing some US/America with some CA)"

If I select limits for an RTCP or a TOP just in the siding the limits field should just read ?siding? instead they are reading as ?Siding Watson?. 
 
The only time the siding should have the station name added is if the TOP limits also extend out of the siding onto the main track.  eg. Siding Watson and Main. In CTC this was to clarify to the foreman his limits of authority when a TOP was combined that encompassed both siding(s) and main tracks.

The text in the location is not displaying when it gets bigger and bolder on transmit.

===============================================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - the ValidatingJTextPane for location field was being created with no columns argument,
which caused the field length to be truncated at default value of 20; also, the SwitchReportBox was not created
so that it would be wide enough to display the entire location field value when the string became too wide(either by font change or by combination of variable width characters in the field)

RESOLUTION: changed SwitchReportBox to use new MAX_CHARS_SWITCH_REPORT_LOCATION_FIELD constant of 48 when creating the location field; changed SwitchReportView to pass box with of 450dlu to to its base class constructor.Also shortened the length of the jgoodies column for the ""reporting"" field (this to keep the form from becoming even wider than it has).

Note: the Switch Report for is now considerable wider than it was; the new values used that govern the form's width were based on being able to visibly show up to 18 'W' characters in the ""reporting"" field, and up to 46 'W' characters in the location field(plus 1 or 2 additional numeric chars); in real practice the location field probably won't need to be so wide; but I wouldn't shorten the addresse/reported-by field any more than was done here, because CN has at various times floated proposals to lengthen fields containing personnel names."

CAUSE: code error:  on CTC-RTC2, the tmt process code was extracting both the length and weight from the train consist description and logging the create; in OCS, no java side log code or logic to do similar extraction of tonage from the consist description existed(the only gensum logging was by TM client operations(move, etc) which was well after the fact of the train create).

RESOLUTION: changed TM to log the train create to vicos; this involved several changes...
 * instead of parsing out the tonage value from the consist description string, added it as argument to the messages in the path from the oracle form up to TM(since it was discovered that we had done that earlier for train length).
* also added xid as argument in messages(because it was not there for TM to use as sendLogToVicos() method argument)
* corrected the CTC behavior of logging only first 4 chars of length and weight(including comma's); OCS logs complete values(e.g. W 12,345 instead of CTC's W 12,3)

Events at the time were rebooting workstation ws9 after it was switched from SPSY to SPUS. WS is also connected to MMI4. Alex says that the logs from MMI4 were showing failed xconnect errors for that time. 

WS9 was able to connect after the failure he was the original workstation that was switched. WS6 and 4 were changed to SPUS and rebooted because there is no logoff available on SPSY.

Based on the logging and what we have seen in the past it is Siemens belief that there were pingable machines in the spectrum domain, or the global domain, that spsy did not have access rights to. Woman will hang while it attempts to RCP files to all of the machines in the cluster with a CID. If the machine cannot be written to woman will hang until the rcp command times out.

CAUSE: code error - the path taken by the second workflow(the workflow that triggers ""only one form at a time"" message) was removing the form backup created by the initial modify(the first workflow, which is still pending); when the first workflow is aborted, we normally rollback the form to its previous state using the form backup; the rollback routine threw an exception because there was no longer a backup from which to restore.

RESOLUTION: to prevent removal of the form backup when the ""one form at a time"" situation occurs, moved the workflow logic that handles form selected from the authority summary into the selection workflow; the Modify, Cancel, and OS Report workflows are affected...Cancel could have caused the same issue; OS Report needed to be done because the change to the selection workflow broke it(needed to be made consistent with the others)


There is probably something wrong with the way the setup is written in the bug report; I was not able to select the form from the summary until it was completed, and was not able to change its addressee after starting a Modify from the TLD(if I did supersede I could change it, but then I couldn't select either the old or the new form from the summary again.

It looks like WM determines what clients to time out on the timer thread and then passes these xId's back to the main thread to remove them. This explains in the logs where wm is being flooded by authorization messages and xId's are being added, removed, added, removed. Instead a message should be sent to the main thread to run a clean up client method that will determine what clients to remove and remove them (that way the client removal calculation is on the same thread as the client alive messages.)

The current behavior makes the system attempt to run up then immediately fail over when all of the workstations connect. This can also cause the system to ping pong back and forth on a failover. "

CAUSE: the cron job that periodically triggers REFDiagnostic's checksum verification of forms in mnesia
invoked the checks as the system was switching over, which caused the REFDiagnosticsMnesiaContainer to
insert a null into its copy of the FormsContainer/PersistencyProvider; the diagnostics later exploded
trying to dereference the null entry to get its checksum.

RESOLUTION: added null checks to the REFDiagnosticsMnesiaContainer initialization method that reads
the mnesia cache, to prevent insertion of null values into its collections, and to write a log message to
the ref.log file when it encounters such nulls.

NOTE: the ref.log files which might have told us more about what happened were not saved and were
long gone by the time we looked at this bug."

CAUSE: code/config error: the max length field value for the LOCATION text field in
oracle forms used for the chief and tech summaries was set to 10 instead of the 12 char
max defined in the trd.fmt(which is the one used in the dispatcher's summary); this 
caused the chief and tech summary exceptions when a train was OS at a known pt where
the OS mileage value included more than 2 char's left of the decimal point(likely also
because of padding done in trd-interface);

RESOLUTION: changed the aforementioned max length  property in the oracle forms involved
to 12(this also included the msd.fmt file used in the dispatcher summary, which didn't
blow up but was inconsistently set to 11)

=======================================================================================================
CASUE: code error - the FormSummaryPresenter was clearing the current form selection and resetting 
the button states to default(no selection) on every form removal.

RESOLUTION: changed the FormSummaryPresenter removeSummaryDisplayFormEntries() and removeSummaryDisplayEntry() methods to not update button states unless the form being removed matches the currently selected form on the summary(former method is used for TOP/WT/PT, latter for RTCProtection forms); also changed updateSummaryDisplayEntry() and setSummaryDisplayEntriesForForm() to do same thing for TOP/RTCP updates...at signoff will found case where this didn't work if cancelling RTCP over two users' terrotory(e.g. on test topology from Bob to Clever and either user can cancel); so also changed FormSummaryView.java to restore selection in removeSummaryDisplayFormEntries()...

REOPEN RESOLUTION: when updates to form are received, the table within the form is refreshed; the selection is briefly turned off deep down in the table model logic, and restored by display entry update logic within the FormSummaryView changes; made for bug #11792 causes the selection to be toggled again when the FormSummaryView tries to restore the selection."

The real bug here is a combination of bug #11574 and the fact that the passive com is validating trains even though the train catalog is not up to date on the passive com until fail over. If the passive com is rejecting due to trains that have been moved/delt with the system has to be failed over. TM should do something similar to REF with the forms on the passive COM."

NOTE: After the form was in this state it was removed using authutil -d. This utility did not clean up the blocking on the trackline which it should have.

==============================================================================
Cause: code error - due to the related bug being fixed, the scenario as described in the variance could not be reproduced unless forced from the debugger...what was happeing is that when REF threw an exception and the standby became PC complete,
the REF on the formerly PC-complete box continued to work - in other words the standby became the primary right away, but before the old primary ran down REF continued to write to amnesia; the new primary then failed, and after the second failover REF restored the form to what was written to mnesia, which included updates that it wrote while it was going down(i.e. while it was no longer running on the primary).

Resolution : make control system bridge process the McSbOrderInf telegram from the spectrum MCS process, and then send the shutdown command to the java applications immediately on receipt of this message having an COMSTATE request and NotConnected state. 

TO TESTERS:
the bug that originally caused the failover has been fixed, so you cannot use the scenario(s) to #12509 to test this one. What you can do to trigger a failover is kill a critical process - for example dbsrv. The system should then failover, and there should be messages in the csbridge.log file saying that it sent a shutdown to each of the java applications. Also make sure that you have the latest imagebus_xxx files installed(IMAGESOS if needed).

--------------------------
Regarding the NOTE above about clean-up-tool.sh -d behavior:
-the -d option will only remove flashing and blocking if the form is in created or issued state and there is a GUI form open for the authority; this is the behavior as implemented for story 10745. In the other cases the user currently needs to use the cleanup tool on the individual device ta's(or -a to refresh ALL the blocking based on the current authority set). All that said, we should file a separate bug if we need to do more.

*note*
* This was reproduced on development system 

This is the full set of scenarios to test for this bug

*Setup:*

Create 2 trains: 11111 and 22222

The following scenario should be executed for the following:

Auth1: PT Auth2: PT
Auth1: PT Auth2: WT (Validation should fail but only because of the lack of Manual Protect Against)

*Scenario 1:*

* Switch Report Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Harry to normal
* Execute Auth1 with train 11111 from George Station to Ingo Station
* Give give West Switch only a permission and give the East switch only a warning
* Complete Auth1.
* Modify Auth1 by cancelling the warning on East Switch at Harry
* Execute Auth2 with train 22222 from Ingo Station to Harry Siding
* Validate

*Expected:*

* Validation should fail two rules
** Auth2 takes a switch reverse but is overlapping a Auth1 that has no warning for that switch
** Auth2 has a switch permission but is overlapping a Auth1 that has no warning for that switch

*Actual:*

* Validation passes

The following scenario should be executed for the following:

Auth1: PT Auth2: PT
Auth1: PT Auth2: WT

*Scenario 2:*

* Switch Report Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Berlin Junction to normal
* Execute Auth1 from Berlin Station to Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Remove Permission from Switch 1 at Berlin Junction
* Add permissions to Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Complete Auth1
* Execute Auth2 from Berlin Station to Apple Station
* Validate authority

*Expected:*

* Validation should fail two rules
** Auth2 takes a Switch 1 at Berlin Junction reverse but is overlapping a Auth1 that has no warning for that switch
** Auth2 has a switch permission for Switch 1 at Berlin Junction but is overlapping a Auth1 that has no warning for that switch

*Actual:*

* We get a 6001 message/failover/Java Exception

*Scenario 3:*

* Switch Report Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Berlin Junction to normal
* Execute PT from Berlin Station to Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Remove Permission from Switch 1 at Berlin Junction
* Add permissions to Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Complete PT
* Execute Switch Report at Switch 1 at Berlin Junction

*Expected:*

* Validation should fail because one cannot move a switch into reverse when the overlapping PT has no warning

*Actual:*

* We get a 6001 message/failover/Java Exception

*Scenario 4:*

* Switch Report Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Berlin Junction to normal
* Execute PT from Berlin Station to Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Remove Permission from Switch 1 at Berlin Junction
* Add permissions to Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Facebook and Switch 1 at Hotmail
* Complete PT
* Execute Switch Report at Siding Switch West at Facebooks

*Expected:*

* Validation should fail because one cannot move a switch into normal when the overlapping PT has a permission on a reversed switch

*Actual:*

* We get a 6001 message/failover/Java Exception

*Scenario 5:*

* Switch Report Siding East Switch and Siding West Switch at Harry to normal
* Execute PT with train 11111 from George Station to Ingo Station
* Give give West Switch only a permission and give the East switch only a warning
* Complete PT.
* Modify PT by cancelling the warning on East Switch at Harry
* Execute Switch Report at East Switch at Harry

*Expected:*

* Rules fail because Overlapping PT has no warning for East Switch at Harry

*Actual:*

* Rules pass

*Scenario 6:*

* Switch Report East Siding Switch at Firewall and East Siding Switch at Harry to normal
* Switch Report West Siding Switch at Harry to reverse
* Execute PT from East Siding Switch at Firewall to Ingo Station
* Add Switch Permission to East Siding Switch at Firewall
* Add Switch Warning to East Siding Switch at Harry
* Complete PT
* Execute Modify on PT
* Uncheck warning for East Siding Switch at Harry
* Transmit

*Expected:*

* Rules on Transmit passes

*Actual:*

* Rules fail saying that West Siding Switch at Harry is reversed cannot cancel"

* Create a new train on a parking spot from the trackline.
* Open Train Summary and view this train. Open the Edit train form for the train.
* Modify the Tracking ID and save the change.

*excepted*
* The trackline train ID should be updated with the new tracking id.

*actual*
* The trackline train ID is not updated.

=====================================================================================================
CAUSE: code error; the SendTmtRename() program called on edit_trd form save was not sending a CSB friendly
messsage to our java apps.

RESOLUTION: changed the SEND_CHANGES() PL/SQL code to instead call SendTmtUpdate(), which formats and sends a softbus message to JMSGATE->CSB->TM->ads that updates all but the train performance data.

REOPEN RESOLUTION: removed test that guarded against null values for lead-engine id/engine number from code block in send_changes() routine dealing with updated tracking id(and added handling of the null values prior to sending update)

=======================================================================
UPDATE 08-15-16 - jim K...
-I was still not able to reproduce this on any system. I tried several locations on both the development topology area and the ""real"" OCS locations. If there is someplace that it is known to happen it needs to be noted here so we can investigate, because in that case it would indicate a problem with the database.-

So, upon further review with Will we could reproduce the problem at in the OCS W.1 development test-topology, when connected to mmi1ocs; further investigation revealed that the SendTmtUpd program was not present in the /home/s/sys/trd folder on mmi1ocs, but was there on mmi3ocs - which was the mmi I was connected to when I could not reproduce the problem. Alex P then found that it was installed on mmi3ocs as result of an update mode configuration error, and that we will need to add the SentTmtUpd executable to the GrafikUpdateObj block configuration to ensure its installation on the mmi's...(still not 100% sure this is the entire solution, particularly because the problem did not always occur at all locations for workstations connected to the problem mmi's)."

* Workstation set up with only two displays. BSD on monitor 1 and overview on Monitor 2.
* Existing PT authority.
* Selected OS report, PT and a KP within the limits.
* OS Report form opened on the second working screen but where I also had my display opened.
* I accidently clicked on the overview display which caused the OS report screen to go in behind. I am assuming because the display is locked it will not allow me to close it or select the OS report to bring it back to the front. I tried Alt-tab but it would not let me select the OS report screen either. So workstation locked up and no method to fix this. It is possible that the RTC will have a display open on the second working screen also so this is not good.

Expected:
* The OS report form should return back to the front of the display after a period of time. 

Actual:
* The OS report is stuck behind and there is no method to get it back.

Expected:
The TrainSummary form contains an entry for your new train(any any others), and has the correct OS Report mileage in its Location field.

Actual:
No train entries on the form.
=======================================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - ImInterface.pc-cep SQL statements to populate oracle tables which are later used to
construct oracle views of train data were missing clauses to include OCS block_type; this caused only a very small subset of the tech areas to be included for the chief and technician summaries and effectively filtered out all of the trains which should have been included on the summary.

RESOLUTION: added *OCS clauses to the trd interface SQL statements everywhere where it had only been checking for CTC block type.

NOTE: the changes will likely affect other functionality besides the train summary, but if so it should be in a good way(i.e. by fixing stuff that had no chance of working before)

REOPEN RESOUTION: applied changes made for bug #12307 to the chief and tech train summary oracle forms(english and french); this involved changing some if-test conditions to check for 'REF' instead 'AUM'. (probably should have reopened 12307)

==================================================================================
CAUSE: configuration error; ../param/ui_supply/config/gong file had message class 1 (which is what the WDAlert used for our testing is set to) configured to ring gong #2; the  ../param/tsbase/ocs.us/config/wm.properties file had the sounds mapped from gong number n to gong1, gong2, etc. and the gong2 file was the bounce sound, instead of the expected siren sound used by the CTC system.

RESOLUTION: brought the siren sound file over from the Bathurst St system; renamed the gong1, gong2, etc sound files according to the sounds they produce; changed the wm.properties file to map both gong #1 and #2 to the siren sound file.

Found by looking at CTC version of gong config that they had message class 1 apparently used for SYSTEM messages and mapped to ""no gong at all""; still need to determine configuration of other alarms/message classes, so mapped the other sound files tentatively...wm.properties now looks like this:

Sound.9-1-1=siren
Sound.9-1-2=siren
Sound.9-1-3=poppedCork
Sound.9-1-4=bouncedPayment
Sound.9-1-5=oldcarHorn
Sound.9-1-6=rattlingCowbell
Sound.9-1-7=mudBubbles
Sound.9-1-8=glassTap

the gong config for message classes now looks like this:

/* \/ Parameters   -------------------------------------------------  */
  Key3               1    2    3    4

NOTE: the TONE relation is apparently no longer used for purposes of playing the gong sound - at least on the workstations...(may no longer be needed at all, but did not try to remove it); the sample field values that are in the tone relation on the CTC test system are not valid(all 0xFF's).

=========================================================================================
CAUSE: code error - for the OS Report problem, the workflow handler to filter away ineligible forms skipped the selected form because its number was not included in the workflow's display stack entries; the supersede problem was caused by the same handler ONLY considering display stack entries: in the cases of cancel and supersede(at least) the id of the selected form is the same as that which is assigned to the workflow, but is not added to the displayStackEntries as part of handling of the dialog response - and so was skipped over instead of being filtered out when form was not completed.

RESOLUTION: to fix the OS Report problem, changed ClientInterface.java's handling of FormListQueryResponseMessage to insert into the workflow's display stack entries the number of the form selected on the form chooser dialog(aka in ctc as overlapBox)  this is needed because the id of the OS Report form itself is assigned to the workflow(never the same as the PT form selected from the chooser).
To fix the bad supersede behavior, changed FilterInvalidSelectionHandler.java to collect the id's of all forms involved - i.e. both the formId associated with the current workflow AND forms added to the displayStackEntries - then filter out any that were marked as having failed rule checks. This causes the selected form to be thrown out if not completed, and the workflow to fail due to lack of eligible form. Also changed the NotCompletedFormFailsRule class to cache the failed form to allow an overridden of the getRuleFailMessage() method to retrieve its form type and number to provide a meaningful popup message."

That is good. Then step 23 has them removing the switch warning and selecting OK.
Then you can transmit the WT authority with the permission and without the warning.
The whole purpose of this requirement was so that it would be issued with both.
You should either disallow the deselection of the warning or disable Transmit or OK if the conditions are not meet. I would prefer the disallow of the deselection.

This is also cutting off the Take siding instruction which possibly means the instruction field is too small?

When a route goes over a topology that provides multiple possible routes, instructions are generated for the switches taken revers. This in conjunction with the take siding at instruction generates instructions that are too long. 

Expected:
These forms should be rejected

Actual:
These forms are not rejected and the instructions field is cutting off the instructions.


NOTE:
The rule looks like it is checking for the instructions text to be less than 200 chars. However, the instructions can only be up to 75 chars.

1. As English RTC user open RTCP form, limits are in bilingual territory.
- Select the RTCP function.
- The start limit in bilingual territory. (ANIM/SEAL/N1TK/TRA)
- The end limit in bilingual territory.(ANIM/SEAL/N4TK/TRA)
- Execute.

*Expected Result:* The form should appear in English.

*Actual Result:* The form appears in French.

CAUSE: code error - to solve an earlier bug, a FormFactory method was changed to prevent errant reset of CP-SPEC related form attributes when limits changed(e.g. whole mile entry); the same logic was used during initial creation of the form object, and was preventing the form's language attribute from being set to that of the field location.

RESOLUTION: added separate routine for setting CP-SPEC related form attributes during initial creation of form object.

NOTE TO TESTER: the location ANIM/SEAL was evidently changed at some point in the database to be Bi-lingual, French-Preferred(since the wiki was not updated to show this, I assume it was a change that was mistakenly pushed)... Therefore, you should expect forms created there to open in French. In the wiki under 'Bilingual Stuff' there are instructions on using MPU to check a location's CPSPEC language infos.

* Correct the incorrect assignment of CTC Main on some tracks.
** Some of the tracks at the bottom of the OCS Test 1 display have CTC Main set when they shouldn't. Other locations as well.
** The crossing/diamond location should be set to CTC (and it should be dark gray)
** The CTC Switch at Polly JCT should be all dark gray (because it is CTC)

The switch should flash based on the position that is required for the limits selection. For example, if the switch is selected in limits where the limit goes over the normal branch of the switch, only the normal branch of the switch should flash.

This also needs to be considered for REF protection flashing. Right now, it is flashing based on the position of the switch, but it should actually flash based on the limits path.

# --1-- --2-- --3-- --4-- --5-- --6-- --7-- #

where # = a known point and switches are items 3 and 6
</pre>

Show that:
* If the user selected limits from the left known point to the right known point
** the selection from CIA (before execution) shows the normal legs of switches 3 and 6 as flashing without the branch legs flashing
** the switch should flash in the normal position regardless of its current position
** it should not change the color of the branch leg.
* If the user selected limits from the left known point to item 9 (which expands to include the right switch):
** the selection from CIA (before execution) shows the reverse leg of switch 3 as flashing without the normal leg flashing
** the switch should flash in the reverse position regardless of its current position
** it should not change the color of the normal leg.
* When REF protects for limits through the normal leg of a switch, it should only flash the normal position of a switch and vice versa.
* For TOP selection, switches that diverge at the end of the limits should only flash the normal leg.

Note: For both CIA and REF, this will require 2 additional infos, one for normal and one for reverse in which CIA sends either or based on the selected path. Also note that for REF, protection checking should stay the same, but we may need to do calculation to turn on protection based on the other infos (or just send both).

Need more info: Dang will check w/ CN regarding if the entire switch is shown as selected or not if it is at the end of a limit and branches out. (DONE)"

** -The user can continue with the form and keep it truncated.-
** -Or the user can select to abort, which should abort the entire form.-

* If there are overlapping PTs in two different directions, each has to be considered for a follow-behind. So if both require a follow-behind, then there would be two follow-behind boxes in the proposed TOP.

** CDLS
** General Summary (when system generates it)
** Archive
** Printing
** Read/repeat
** (all the usual stuff, if questions, ask)

* For the follow behind to be valid, the limits of the proposed TOP must follow the path (switch positions) of the last train.

* Make sure you cannot lengthen whole miles.

* Validate limits should regenerate restrictions (follow behind).

* -PAs only ""activate"" ONCE. Meaning, once a TOP is cancelled that a PA applied to, another TOP cannot be created for it. (should apply to all authorities).-
** -It should ""activate"" when the proposed authority is persisted unacknowledged.-
** -Full PA is used even if TOP does not take up the entire PA.-
** -It is considered ""activated"" as long as the new authority matches, even if the scenario causes a ""follow behind"" instead.-

* CDLS shows up where appropriate (follow when TOP logs)

* -How do we actually calculate the location for box 7 (when PT overlap at different points)?-
* -Is it correct to combine restrictions for same addressee?-
* -Confirm w/ CN that whole miles for the proposed form can only be done before adding manual restriction (because it may affect manually added restrictions, in this case what to do about them?)-
** -Related: If proposed form already is using whole miles, and selection of new restrictions is outside of this, how to handle? automatically reduce it? or prompt the user to change limits on form?...Probably do it the same way as limits for form where user has to manually change it (and validate). The system could fill in numbers automatically if desired.-
* -Do we care about selection color of restriction being added? Flashing different color may be complicated...depending on how its done. TFlash is no go...-
* -What does ""Train/Foreman"" button do? Does it add ""Foreman"" to the addressee? When? What about the user editing it after ""Foreman"" is already there?-

* In the form create mode before transmit:
** There is a new button called ""Validate Limits""
** The start and end limits are editable
** When focus goes into either the start or end limit, and the field has not been edited, it is ""cleared"" so that the user can enter in a mileage. (It should be considered not having been edited each time a successful validate happens).
** When focus goes into either the start or end limit, but the field was already edited, then it should not clear the field. (Though editing is still allowed).
** When focus is lost, and it was not yet edited (and blank), then the original contents of the last successful validate is filled back in.
** Transmit is disabled if the limits have been edited (or the fields are empty).
** Validate Limits should become enabled if either of the start/end limits are edited and are valid mileages (based on form validation).
** ""Valid Mileages"" for the start limit are the mileages from the initial start limit to the very next known point or switch in the direction of the limits, but not including the mileage on that known point or switch.
** ""Valid mileages"" for the end limit are the mileages from the second to last switch or known point in the direction of the limits through to the end point, but not including the mileage of the second to last switch or known point.
** When the user is editing in the start or end limit field (the field has focus), the status line should indicate what the valid mileages are.
** The start/end limits should show the usual red error background for invalid entries.
* The rules are rerun when the user clicks on validate limits.
* The boxes are recalculated when the user clicks on validate limits. (For example, if the overlap box no longer applies because the mileage is outside the overlap, then overlap gets removed).
* If the validate limits fails, the user gets the usual notification (reject/query) AND the form becomes editable again with the state right before the validate limits button being clicked (To be checked w/ CN -- does it go back to initially picked limits? stay as the unvalidated limits? or completely get aborted?).
* If the validate limits succeeds, the form display is updated with the new contents.
** Mileage entries are to include the ""Mile"" string (Obey bilingual rules, so it should be french if form is french).
** If only the start limit is a mileage entry, then include the subdivision name. (e.g.: ""Mile 100 Facebook Sub""
** If both start and end are mileages, then the subdivision name is only in the END limit field.
** If each start/end are in different subs, then each should have the subdivision name.
* After successful validation of limits, the TLD shall show the shortened limits (items that are not within the start/end mileages should not be included -- edges should not count)
* The Authority Summary should show the start and end limits as mileages in the same way as they show up on the form itself.

Ask CN:
* Are there special formatting rules for mileage number formats? decimals? for certain numbers?
** Answer: Formatting for mileages when user entered should simply be the whole mile (there is no decimal). When the item's name itself has the mileage, then keep that formatting as is."

p(. All open forms in REF are keep track of in a mapping of workflow id to client display instance id. Currently a workflow is a display. If there is a workflow opened it is either in the process of bringing up a form, allowing the user to fill out a form or closing a form, for our purposes when a workflow is opened a form is opened. This gets somewhat butchered when sub workflows are taken into consideration because sub workflows can bring up ""forms"" or dialogs, but they do not have to. In the main workflows when the workflow end action node is hit one of the workflow listeners is triggered with a ""workflowDone"" call and the workflow instance id is removed from the ""workflow with display instances"" entry for that workflow from the map. Similarly in the end sub workflow action handler there is a call to the ui manager that removes any entries for the sub workflow in the ""workflow with display instances"".

the rules are in:
* checkRollupReject.drl 
* checkFulfillReject.drl

didn't name xxxFail like the others because they don't cause the parent OS report form to abort...

Integration tests are in:
* RolluoSubworkflowTest.java
* FulfillSubworkflowTest.java

Unit tests are in:
* CheckRollupRejectTest.java
* CheckFulfillRejectTest.java

Resource strings used by rules include .Rollup. or .Fulfill. in their keys.


general scheme description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During execution of the parent os report form workflow, the Rollup or Fullfill subwrkflow is executed for each rollup/fullfill candidate form collected by the parent form workflow. 

The parent workflow's user messages container is passed down to the subworkflow(via inclusion of the CLIENT_MESSAGES workflow variable in the 'variablesToCopy' string given to the StartSubworkflowActionHandler invocation.

Any userMessages created as result of subworkflow rule execution are added to the container and copied back up to the parent workflow as specified by inclusion of CLIENT_MESSAGES in the 'variablesToCopy' string given to the EndSubworkflowHandler that is invoked at the end of the rollup/fullfill sub-workflows; also copied back up to the parent are the rulesPassed and rulesFailed boolean variables.

After the last sub-workflow ends, the parent workflow tests the rulesFailed value in a check_drools_result decision node; if rulesFailed is true, a dialog is opened with all of the userMessages collected during execution of each sub-workflow(otherwise we go on our merry way to the unset_item_falshing node). The only button/choice from the dialog is 'Continue'; once pressed, the user response and message content is sent to the general summary, and then the workflow continues on to the unset_item_flashing node.

The receiving server checks for expected messages in the buffer and removes them from the buffer for processing.
Messages that were sent from a different server are never picked up and cause the buffer to grow, causing eventually an out-of-heap-space error.

The solution for this problem is to not buffer the messages that were received from a different server.

This fix is not easily testable without looking at the code (debugging).
A possible way to test this fix is to have a redundant system (2 COMs) running for a long time and to
a) look at the size of the buffer - make sure it's not growing (e.g. with a debugger attached)
b) not have a out-of-heap-space error (which might occur due to other code issues) after a long time of running"

* Place a TOP from switch A to switch B on the main line

- Press ""Validate limits""
Result: Limits are not valid
- Shorten the limits of X3 to X1 on the X1 side

Expected result: Limits are not valid
Current result: Limits are valid with After restriction

Note: The After restriction should only be valid if the proposed PT overlaps all opposing PTs on the proposed start limit.

(4/20/15) Findings so far:
If the limits are selected as described, the first item of X3 to X1 is actually the switch to the left of X3.
The limits of the overlap (since it gets reversed) is not from X2 to X1, but from the switch to the left of X3(and X2) to X1."

old UPDATE: for time being added a logic to insert fake messages into the table on web2, plus a button to trigger it from JobMonitor...this to be able to continue making story progress in other areas where playback needs attention...

general problem is that Oracle 64bit libs were/are being linked to soins/soinc; I changed src/build/NEEDS/Oracle.need and OracleStatic.need to force linking with the libs in ../11.2.0/32bitlib - after checking that the users of the libs were compiled as 32 bit ELF exe's; but this breaks the nightly build...for ImTrdInterface, linker complains about lib.2.so conflicting with lib.1.so ; others likely would have failed as well if the build hadn't borked out there)...

we can either bang on the library link issues until everyone is happy about the 32bitlib's, or we can compile the spectrum executables(or perhaps some subset) as 64 bit; if doing all of them it likely will mean work on protocol code(per Goran), and who knows what else(IMHO customers will not be happy getting a 64 bit OS upgrade and the old apps still running as 32) - jim

currently these spectrum processes fail to logon to oracle and bail out, causing no general summary or alarm messages to be written to the hfd1 SID's MESSAGES table, from which playback extracts the event messages it displays; this is also preventing playback from initializing and starting up properly, since the lack of records in the MESSAGES table causes one of the main queries in playback to trigger a ""no data available"" condition"

Currently we have discussed the possibility of slamming the client shut after a period of time as well as the possibility of not buffering any user actions on the work station. Our understanding at this point is as follows:

* The buffering of mouse clicks is an artifact of the X server using TCP to communicate between the client and server and seems to be out of our hands if we use the workstations X server (the internet agrees)
* The client only slams shut after the network cable is plugged back in (it looks like spectrum is timing out and slamming the clients shut).

Option 1:
* We write an application/integrate into an existing application running on the workstation to slam the x windows shut after we cannot talk to the mmi anymore
** The complication with this is what do we do if the connection is slammed shut on the workstation side but not on the vicos side. will the clients still be alive while the workstation is dead?
** How do we detect when the x server is 'frozen' is a ping good enough? can an x connection die for any other reason other than all communication going away. what is a port is blocked?

Option 2:
* We get spectrum to slam the client shut sooner (it looks like it is setup to die within 2 min. we would like to get this down to 1 min) and see if the customer is fine with the client not dying until the network is restored or the user interferes.

CN has agreed that the current behavior of the workstation is acceptable as outlined by clarification log entry D"

* Rollup
* Fulfill
* OS Report comments

OS Reports should be written into whatever OS Graph/Train Graph is using for depicting points on the train graph. Note this may require data model changes... (OS locations are specific to a PT).

Show that:
* Every OS report coming from REF shows up in the OS location table of the train record
* Every OS location change shows as a dot on the TGI
* Every PT or WT for the train shows in the Authority section of the train record
* Location changes that are triggered not by OS reports (creations, moving out of parking spots, between parking spots) show up in the location table (upper table of train record), NOT in OS location table
* When a PT is fulfilled, a dot is drawn at the end location of that PT
* All dots belonging to the PT (Start, OS location changes, Fulfill) are connected
* Comments from the OS report are applied to the train record of the PTs addressee
* Dots of multiple PTs for the same train are not connected
* Times show up in the field time of the control point
NOTE: per Peter, it is OK for the top section of the train record form to show the Last RTC Update time in the time of the box that the RTC added the PT form; the middle section of the form which includes the OS report times are in the field time of the OS location"

|SRS.702 | System Security | needs to be changed once you guys figure out what scripts are usable/applicable||
|SRS.691 | The system shall allow for workstations to be monitored via coma or SNMP. | Should reflect what the system actually does using COMA and the functionalities that we have provided in COMA||

|SRS.1241 | The system shall not display the zeros after the decimal point, if a field contains a mileage ending with .00 | Should be linked to QL entries 126, 279, 446||

|SRS.850|The system shall provide the capability to pick a known point from the Track Line as part of the selection when requesting an OS Report.| This requirement mentions known points but not switches.

|SRS.574|The system shall consider an OS mileage or location at or beyond the To limit of a PT authority to be valid to fulfill that PT authority.|What does beyond mean?| |

h2. Outstanding Issues

What other performance requirements do we have?
* Number of forms in an hour (peak throughput)
* Average number of forms in the system (constant load)
* Number of trains per hour (peak throughput)
* Number of trains in the system (constant load)

* Do we have any requirements that dictate that a form cannot be shorted passed a ""block"" or passed a known point or switch?

* The requirements regarding copy train and move train are all actually talking about move train. This is confusing to both CN and Siemens
* The requirements regarding All Auth and View All are all actually talking about the All Auth button on the Authority Summary
* We should make a distinction in our requirements between blocking items, protecting items, and locking items. It may make sense to just never say ""protection"" seeing as this means 2 different things to development and customer."

*Question:*
1/6/2016
Currently the track lines on the working screens cannot be minimized, moved, closed, panned, etc. when a form is opened. This was done to fulfill the requirement SRS. 923. This makes it so if a track line is brought to the front things can get stuck behind the track line. The only way to get things from behind the track line back to the front is alt tab if the user knows that something has been pushed to the background. Is this what we want?

1/25/2016
Can we also allow re-transmit from the working screens so we can allow all functionalities from the form view from the working screens and disallow all other form operations?

2/3/2016
1) When we say we should not restrict track lines on working screens, to us this means the user can open, close, move, minimize, resize, replace these track lines. 

2) How should track lines opened using the BSD on overview screens behave?

*Answer:*
1/6/2016
No, Track lines on the working screens should not lock. Track lines on the working screens should also not allow any form operations other than view and unlock.

1/27/2016
We should not restrict operations on the working screen track lines. 

Only track lines on the overview screens should lock

2/3/2016
1) This is correct

2) If the track line is brought up using the quick callup as an overview screen, the track line is locked. If the track line is brought up using the BSD OCS button on the BSD we should not lock it, even if a form is opened. This includes track lines that are opened from the BSD on working screens as well as track lines that are brought up on overview screens using the OCS button on the BSD

*Show That:*
* When a form is opened/operated on, all overview track lines are locked
* When a form is opened/operated on, all non overview track lines are not locked

11904,Task,Release 5X,,Signed Off,4,[NewMissed] Support Canadian Multilingual Standard (CMS) keyboard map on workstation,Peter Zwolinski,Jim Kelliher,"Feb 11, 2016 11:04 AM",,Release 5_4,"Oct 06, 2015 12:00 AM",,24,0,100,"Aug 28, 2015 09:32 AM",,,37,20,Sean Breid,,No,1,CN OCS,,,,"Show that:
* The CMS keyboard map is supported on the workstation

From email (RTC2 CTC):
The CMS layout is not supported by Sun Microsystems and as such, no matching keymap table is available from the OEM for Solaris 8. The CMS layout is depicted [in the attachment].

In order to make all characters from the CMS keyboard available in the RTC2 system, a standard keymap table was modified and renamed; thus creating a new (custom) keymap table for CN to use with the CMS keyboards. The new keymap table has been named as follows: US6CanFrCMS.kt.Z
 
Naming convention:
US6 -> Original file based on US6 standard (Standard en_US mapping table for USB)
CanFr -> Canadian French (supported language/characters)
CMS -> Canadian Multilingual Standard (keyboard layout)
.kt.Z -> .kt (standard extension for keymap tables), .Z (compressed)
 
Installation procedure:
On the MMI:
1. Uncompress the tar file.
2. cdm, STOPSOS
3. Extract tar file on to: /usr/openwin/share/etc/keytables/
4. Log in as root (su)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The strategy outlined above was not taken because the CN_OCS system is using redhat/linux
workstations(no BSD displays direct from the MMI); support for the Canadian Multilingual keyboard is included with the linux installs.

The situation is further complicated by story #11526, for which the current solution - to stop the number-lock from interfering with oracle field tabbing - involves disabling the number lock key; to do that we provide a custom keymapping that is run in by openbox autostart at login time - based on whether the workstation is setup as a french or english workstation (looks first on the value of SPECLANG(not normally set on non-spectrum workstations, and then on the value of environment variable LANG)
